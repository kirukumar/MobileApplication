# E-Commerce Mobile Backend Application

This backend application is developed using **Java Spring Boot** and is designed to manage mobile phone products for an e-commerce platform. It provides a comprehensive REST API to perform operations like adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting mobile phone records, along with various filters such as brand, model, color, processor type, and more.

## Description

The application primarily handles mobile phone catalog management through a set of endpoints exposed via the `MobileController`. It supports the following:

- Basic CRUD operations for mobile phones
- Filtering by brand, model, color, and processor
- Querying for phones above a certain price
- Counting unique models by brand
- Working with DTOs for data transfer efficiency

It uses a `MobilePhoneService` layer to interact with the database and encapsulate business logic.
